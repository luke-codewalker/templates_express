# templates_express
A template for a simple express server meant to be used with [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit).

## About 

I got tired of typing out the same code every time I wanted to setup a simple NodeJS Express server so I made this template. It is customized to my needs and preferences and meant for simple prototypes not production apps. Feel free to use it as described below or make your own fork to customize it.

## How to scaffold a new project
Copy the template:
```
npx degit luke-codewalker/templates_express your-project-name
```

Install the dependency and run the server in development mode:
```
npm i && npm run dev
```

Happy hacking ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰!
